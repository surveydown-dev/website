To help you get started with surveydown, we created some templates that cover many of the features of the package. Feel free to use any as a starting point for your own surveys or as a reference for specific features.

Call `sd_create_survey()` with proper arguments to create your desired templates in your preferred directory. Refer to the [Start with a template](/docs/getting-started.html#start-with-a-template) section for more details.
