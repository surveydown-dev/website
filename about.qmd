## What is surveydown?

**surveydown** is a flexible, open-source platform for making surveys with {{< var rproject >}}, {{< var quarto >}}, {{< var shiny >}}, and {{< var postgres >}}. Here's how it works:

1. Design your survey as a {{< var quarto >}} document using markdown and R code.
2. Render your survey into a {{< var shiny >}} app that can be hosted online and sent to respondents.
3. Store survey response data in a {{< var postgres >}} database. We recommend {{< var supabase >}} as a free, secure, and easy to use option.

The {surveydown} R package provides functions to bring this all together.

## Why surveydown?

Most survey platforms (e.g., Google forms, Qualtrics, etc.) use graphic interfaces or spreadsheets to define survey content, making version control, collaboration, and reproducibility difficult or impossible. The surveydown package was designed to address these problems. As an open-source, markdown-based platform, all survey content is defined using **plain text** (markdown and R code) in two files:

- `survey.qmd`: A {{< var quarto >}} document that contains the survey content (pages, questions, etc).
- `app.R`: An R script defining a shiny app that contains global settings (libraries, database configuration, etc.) and server configuration options (e.g., conditional skipping / display, etc.).

This approach makes your survey easy to reproduce, share, and version control with common tools like Git. And since all survey data is stored in a {{< var postgres >}} database, you have total control over where your survey data lives. We provide direct support for {{< var supabase >}} as a free, secure, and easy to use option.

In case you're interested in the background behind the project, this [blog post](https://www.jhelvy.com/blog/2023-04-06-markdown-surveys/) provides something of an origin story. Note that the design discussed in the post is now quite outdated with what ultimately became surveydown.

## Authors

The surveydown project is led by professor [John Paul Helveston](https://www.jhelvy.com/) at George Washington University and was originally developed in collaboration with his students [Pingfan Hu](https://pingfanhu.com) and [Bogdan Bunea](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bogdanbt/). 

As an open-source package, surveydown now has many more contributors who have added features and improved the project over time. See the [**Contributors' Page**](https://github.com/surveydown-dev/surveydown/graphs/contributors) for details.
