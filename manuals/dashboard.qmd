The surveydown package has a dashboard app for viewing and modifying your database credentials as well as viewing your survey data. To launch the dashboard, run the following in your R console:

```{r}
surveydown::sd_dashboard()
```

This will open a new browser window where you can navigate to the dashboard for your project. It should look like this:

<br>
<center>
<img src="../images/screenshots/dashboard.png" width=100%>
</center>
<br>

Click on the "Connection Settings" tab to see and edit your database credentials. Once you have made changes, click on the "Test Connection" button to save your updated credentials.

Click on the "Dashboard" tab to view your survey data. The drop down menu just above the "Dashboard" tab allows you to select which database table you want to view.

The dashboard shows you a summary of your survey data. You can also download a CSV file of your survey data by clicking on the "Download CSV" button.
