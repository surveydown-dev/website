title: "Conditional Question Display"
---

It is often useful to have a question display based on some condition, such as the respondent choosing a particular value in a multiple choice question. 

For example, let's say we have a choice question about people's favorite penguin type, and the last option is "other". If the respondent chose it, you may want a second question to display that allows them to specify the "other" penguin type, like this:

<center>
<img src="../images/screenshots/show_if.gif" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;">
</center>
<br>

To implement this, you first need to define both the **conditional question** and the **target question** in the `survey.qmd` file, like this:

```{r}
#| echo: fenced

# Conditional question
sd_question(
  type  = "mc",
  id    = "penguins",
  label = "Which is your favorite type of penguin?",
  option = c(
    "Ad√©lie"    = "adelie",
    "Chinstrap" = "chinstrap",
    "Gentoo"    = "gentoo",
    "Other"     = "other"
  )
)

# Target question
sd_question(
  type  = "text",
  id    = "penguins_other", 
  label = "Please specify the other penguin type:"
)
```

Then in the server function in the `app.R` file, you can use the `sd_show_if()` function to define that the `"penguins_other"` question would only be shown if the respondent chose the `"other"` option in the `"penguins"` question, like this:

```{r}
server <- function(input, output, session) {

  sd_show_if(
    input$penguins == "other" ~ "penguins_other" 
  )

  sd_server(db = db)

}
```

The structure of the condition in the `sd_show_if()` function is always:

> `<condition> ~ "target_question_id"`

You can provide multiple conditions to the `sd_show_if()` function, each separated by a comma. 

In the example above, `input$penguins == "other"` is the condition, and `"penguins_other"` is the target question that will be shown if the condition is met. The `~` symbol is used to separate the condition from the target question.

Take a look at the [Common Conditions](common-conditions.qmd) page for examples of other types of supported conditions you can use to conditionally display questions.

The `input` object is a Shiny object that stores each question `id` defined by `sd_question()` in your `survey.qmd` file, so whenever referring to a question in a condition, you must use the format `input$question_id`.
