Every surveydown survey is composed of a _survey_ and an _app_, defined in two separate files:

- **survey.qmd**: A {{< var quarto >}} document that contains the main survey content, such as pages, questions, and navigation buttons. It is a standard Quarto document, so you can use any text editor or IDE to insert content.
- **app.R**: An R script defining a Shiny app that contains the global settings (libraries, database configuration, etc.) and any server configurations (e.g., conditional page skipping / question display, etc.).

These files must be named **survey.qmd** and **app.R**.
