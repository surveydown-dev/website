This page discusses how to create pages and navigate between them in a surveydown survey.

## Defining pages

In surveydown, pages can be defined using two different syntax options: 

- **Shorthand syntax** (recommended) 
- **Fence syntax**

### Shorthand syntax

The shorthand syntax uses three dashes `---` followed by the page ID to mark the start of a page. Each new page delimiter automatically closes the previous page, so you don't need explicit closing tags:

```{r}
--- page1

Page 1 content here

--- page2

Page 2 content here
```

This is the recommended approach as it's more concise and easier to read.

### Fence syntax

Alternatively, you can define pages using fences (`:::`), which explicitly mark both the start and end of each page:

```{r}
::: {.sd_page id=page1}

Page 1 content here

:::

::: {.sd_page id=page2}

Page 2 content here

:::
```

With fence syntax, we use three colon symbols `:::`, called a "fence", to mark the start and end of pages. This notation is commonly used in Quarto for a variety of use cases, like defining [subfigures](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#subfigures) in images.

In the starting fence, you need to define the class as `.sd_page` and provide a page id (e.g. `page1` and `page2` in the example above). Then anything you put between the page fences will appear on that page.

Both syntaxes work identically - choose whichever you find more readable.

If you are using RStudio, you can also make use of the page gadget to create pages under the "Addins" dropdown menu. You can easily link the gadget with a keyboard shortcut from the "Tools" menu. Check out [this blog post](/blog/2025-04-08-surveydown-gadgets/) for a detailed walkthrough.

Here is what the **Survey Page Gadget** looks like in RStudio:

## Navigation buttons

By default, navigation buttons are automatically added to each page to allow respondents to move forward through the survey. To change the global settings (e.g., add a previous button on all pages, change the message shown on all next buttons, etc.), you can edit the survey settings in the YAML header (see the [Survey Settings](survey-settings.html#default-settings) page for details).

Additionally, you can also manually add navigation buttons using the `sd_nav()` function inside code chunks on any page, which will override the global settings for that specific page, like this: 

```{r}
#| echo: fenced

sd_nav()
```

The `sd_nav()` function allows you control over the labels using the `label_next` and `label_prev` arguments, e.g.:

- `label_next = "Next Page"`
- `label_prev = "Previous Page"`
 
You can also control whether to show either button at all using the following arguments:

- `show_next`: Set to `TRUE` or `FALSE` to show the next button or not.
- `show_prev`: Set to `TRUE` or `FALSE` to show the previous button or not.
- `show_buttons`: Set to `TRUE` or `FALSE` to show both buttons or not.

Finally, you can also control which page to navigate to next using the `page_next` argument (see [Direct Forward Skipping](#direct-forward-skipping) below). 

## Skipping Forward

### Direct Forward Skipping

You can send the survey respondent to other forward pages by changing the value assigned to the `page_next` argument in the `sd_nav()` function. For example, to send the user to a page with the id `page3`, you can use:

```{r}
#| echo: fenced

sd_nav(page_next = 'page3')
```
