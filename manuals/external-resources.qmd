title: "External Resources"
---

Often times you will want to include external resources in your survey, things like images, videos, etc. While you can easily include these in your `survey.qmd` file by referencing their location in your survey project folder, these resources may not always be available in the shiny app defined in your `app.R` file.

To address this, you should always place external resources in a separate folder and then make sure that folder is added to Shiny's resource path. You can do this in your `app.R` file by using the `sd_include_folder()` function at the beginning of the file after loading the `surveydown` package, like this:

```{r}
library(surveydown)

sd_include_folder("resources")
```

This will make all files in a folder called `resources` available to Shiny. 

## Default folders

The `surveydown` package will automatically add the following folders to Shiny's resource path:

- `www`
- `images`
- `css`
- `js`

If any of these folders exist in your project, they will automatically be added to Shiny's resource path. For this reason, we recommend that you always put images inside a `images` folder in your project directory, css files inside a `css` folder, and so on. This will make it easier to manage your resources and ensure that they are always available to Shiny.
