title: "Storing Data"
---

Survey response data is stored in a PostgreSQL database. We recommend using {{< var supabase >}} as it is free and open-source, though you can use any service you want.

In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps for setting up a Supabase project and connecting your surveydown survey to it.

## Setting up a Supabase project

First, navigate to the {{< var supabase >}} website and create an account.

Once you are logged in, the page will prompt you to create a project (it's a green button). Click on it and select your organization. A dialog box will pop up like this:

<br>
<center>
<img src="../images/screenshots/supabase-project.png" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;">
</center>
<br>

Fill in the project name and give it a strong password. Choose a region that is close to you (or close to your survey audience). All settings can be modified at any time.

Each Supabase project is a database that can store multiple tables. Since each surveydown survey requires only one table, you can use the same Supabase project for multiple surveydown surveys.

## Getting your Supabase credentials

Once your Supabase project is ready, click on the "connect" button at the top, it should look like this:

<br>
<center>

</center>
<br>

On the connection page, scroll down to the "Transaction pooler" section. There you can click on the "View parameters" drop down to see your connection parameters. It should look somethinglike this:

<br>
<center>
<img src="../images/screenshots/supabase-connection.png" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;">
</center>
<br>

You will need these parameters and your password to connect to your database in surveydown.

## Storing your database credentials

Before connecting to your database, you need to store your credentials. You can do this by running the following code in your R console:

```{r}
surveydown::sd_db_config()
```

This function will prompt you to enter your database credentials and password, one by one. The current credential values will be shown in square brackets. When done it should look like this:

<br>
<center>
<img src="../images/screenshots/sd-db-config.png" width=60%>
</center>
<br>

Once you have entered your credentials, the function will store them in a `.env` file in your project folder. **We strongly recommend that you do not manually edit this file or share it with others as it stores all of your database credentials, including your password.**

## Modifying credentials 

If you want to modify your credentials stored in the `.env` file, you can just run `sd_db_config()` again and press 'Enter' on any parameter you want to leave unchanged while modifying the ones you want to change. 

You can also pass any of the parameters as arguments to `sd_db_config()` to change them. For example, if you wanted to only change the table name, you could do this:

```{r}
sd_db_config(table = 'mytable')
```

Once run in the R console, a message will print out confirming that the stored `table` parameter will now be `mytable`.

You can pass any of the following as arguments: `host`, `dbname`, `port`, `user`, `table`, `password`, and `gssencmode`

Finally, you can also view / modify your database credentials in the surveydown dashboard app. To do this, launch the dashboard by running this command in the R console:

```{r}
surveydown::sd_dashboard()
```

This will open a new browser window where you can navigate to the dashboard for your project. Click on the "Connection Settings" tab to see and edit your database credentials. Once you have made changes, click on the "Test Connection" button to save your updated credentials.

See the [Local Dashboard](local-dashboard.html) page for more information.

## Connecting to your database in surveydown

Now that you have set your credentials stored, you can connect to your database in surveydown by running the following code in your **app.R** file:

```{r}
db <- sd_db_connect()
```

You do not need to specify any arguments to this function as it will automatically use the credentials stored in your `.env` file. If the connection is successful, you should see a message in the console that says "✔ Successfully connected to the database." 

You can also ignore the database connection by setting `ignore = TRUE` in `sd_db_connect()`:

```{r}
db <- sd_db_connect(ignore = TRUE)
```

With this setting, no database connection will be attempted, and the `db` object will store the value `NULL`. Instead, data will be stored in a local `preview_data.csv` file for previewing purposes only. This is useful when you are still editing your survey and do not want to store any data in your database yet.

## Disabling `gssencmode`

If you have set all of your credentials correctly but are still encountering connection errors, try setting the `gssencmode` parameter to `"disable"` when running `sd_db_config()`.

By default, `gssencmode` is set as `"prefer"`. It secures your connection with PostgreSQL. We generally recommend that you **DO NOT disable `gssencmode`**, but sometimes this is necessary, especially when you are working on a protected network, such as a VPN.
