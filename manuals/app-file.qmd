```

This page details the contents of the `app.R` file, where you define the global settings and server logic for your survey. It defines a Shiny app, so if you are familiar with Shiny you should feel right at home.

The main components of the `app.R` file are:

- **Global settings**: where you load the surveydown package and define the database connection.
- **Server**: where you define the logic of the survey (conditional question display / conditional survey flow, etc.)

## Global settings

The global settings are at the top of the `app.R` file. At a minimum, you need to load the `surveydown` package and define the database connection. You can also load other packages / global objects here if you need to. It typically looks like this:

```{r}
library(surveydown)

# sd_db_config()
db <- sd_db_connect()
```

The `db` object is used to store survey data - see the [Storing Data](storing-data.qmd) page for details on how to set up the database connection.

## Server

The `server()` function is a standard Shiny server function that takes `input`, `output`, and `session` as arguments. It is where you can set custom control logic and other configuration options, such as [conditional question display](conditional-question-display.qmd) logic with the `sd_show_if()` function, or [conditional survey flow](conditional-survey-flow.qmd) logic with the `sd_skip_forward()` function.

{{< include ../chunks/server.qmd >}}

The `sd_server()` function at the bottom makes everything run. It also includes some optional arguments that you can use to customize the survey. 

See the [Server Options](server-options.qmd) page for details on the different options you can use to customize the server.

::: {.callout-note}

The `db = db` argument in `sd_server()` is required if you are using a database connection, which should be defined using the `sd_database()` function as mentioned above in the [Global Settings](#global-settings) section. See the [Store Data](storing-data.qmd) page for more details.

## Run code

At the very bottom of the `app.R` file, you will see the following code:

```{r}
shiny::shinyApp(ui = sd_ui(), server = server)
```

This code defines the Shiny app and should always be at the bottom of the `app.R` file.

**What's with the `sd_ui()` thing?**

In a typical Shiny app, you have to define the UI and server functions separately. In a surveydown survey, the UI is a fixed structure that is defined by the `sd_ui()` function, so simply provide it to the `ui` argument in `shiny::shinyApp()` to run the survey.

## Locally running the survey

To preview your survey, you can run the Shiny app locally by clicking the "Run App" button in RStudio or in your R console run the code `shiny::runApp('app.R')`. Typically, RStudio will launch the app in a new window, but you can also choose to have the app launch in a dedicated viewer pane, or in your external web browser. Make your selection by clicking the icon next to Run App:
