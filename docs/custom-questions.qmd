If you have an html widget that isn't yet directly supported by surveydown, you can still use it by defining it in the server and using the `sd_question_custom()` function to store the value in the resulting survey data.

## Basic Syntax

Use the `sd_question_custom()` function to create custom questions. The function requires the following arguments:

- `id`: A unique identifier for the question, which will be used as the variable name in the resulting survey data (just like the `id` in `sd_question()`).
- `label`: The label that will be displayed on the question in the survey.
- `output`: The output widget. This needs to be an output function designed for shiny, e.g. `leafletOutput()`, `plotOutput()`, etc.
- `value`: The value to be returned by the question. This must be a reactive value that updates based on user interaction with the `output` widget (e.g. selecting a state on a leaflet map).
- `height` (optional): The height of the widget in pixels, defaults to 400.

Below is the basic syntax for creating a custom question:

```r
sd_question_custom(
  id     = "some_id",
  label  = "Some Label",
  output = "some_output_widget",
  value  = "some_reactive_value"
)
```

To make `sd_question_custom()` work, you need to define the UI and functionality you want in the `server()` function in the **app.R** file. We have two examples that show how to set this up: an interactive map using leaflet, and an interactive plot using plotly.

## Leaflet Map Example

To reproduce this example, proceed to the [Custom Leaflet Map](../templates/13_custom_leaflet_map.html) template. This template has a leaflet map that looks like the map below. When a user clicks on the map, it turns orange and stores the selected state in the resulting survey response data:

> Which state do you live in?

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| message: false

# Helper function for modifying the leaflet map layout
map_layout <- function(map, states, selected_state = NULL) {

    # Set the state fill colors
    color <- "lightblue"
    if (!is.null(selected_state)) {
      color <- ifelse(states$NAME == selected_state, "orange", "lightblue")
    }

    # Update the polygons
    addPolygons(
      map,
      data = states,
      fillColor = color,
      weight = 2,
      opacity = 1,
      color = "white",
      fillOpacity = 0.7,
      layerId = states$NAME,
      highlight = highlightOptions(
        weight = 3,
        color = "#666",
        fillOpacity = 0.7,
        bringToFront = TRUE
      ),
      label = ~NAME,
      labelOptions = labelOptions(
        style = list(
          padding = "3px 8px",
          "background-color" = "rgba(255,255,255,0.8)"
        ),
        textsize = "15px"
      )
    )
}

# Create the main leaflet map widget
leaflet(options = leafletOptions(
  preferCanvas = TRUE,
  scrollWheelZoom = FALSE
)) |>
  addTiles() |>
  setView(lng = -98.5795, lat = 39.8283, zoom = 4) |>
  addEasyButton(easyButton(
    position = "bottomleft",
    icon = "fa-undo",
    title = "Reset View",
    onClick = JS("function(btn, map){
    map.setView([39.8283, -98.5795], 4);
  }")
  )) |>
  map_layout(states)
```

## Plotly Chart Example

To reproduce this example, proceed to the [Custom Plotly Chart](../templates/14_custom_plotly_chart.html) template. This template has a plotly scatterplot map that looks like the chart below. When a user clicks on one of the points, it displays the point value and stores the point in the resulting survey response data:

> Click on a point to select it:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| message: false

plot_ly(
    mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg,
    type = "scatter",
    mode = "markers",
    source = "scatter_plot"
) %>%  # Add source identifier
    layout(dragmode = "select")   # Enable point selection
```
