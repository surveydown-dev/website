All survey configuration settings are defined within the `server` function in the `app.R` file. The `server()` function is a standard Shiny server function that takes `input`, `output`, and `session` as arguments.

{{< include ../chunks/server.qmd >}}

The `sd_skip_forward()` and `sd_show_if()` functions are used to define logic for [conditionally displaying questions](conditional-question-display.qmd) or [conditionally controlling survey flow](conditional-survey-flow.qmd).

The `sd_server()` function is used to run the survey. It handles the main logic, such as page navigation and managing the survey data. The `db = db` argument is required if you are using a database connection, which should be defined using the `sd_database()` function (see the [Store Data](storing-data.qmd) page for more details).

The `sd_server()` function also has many other optional arguments that can be used to customize the survey behavior. This page details these options.

## Required questions

By default, no questions are required. However, you can make questions required by providing a vector containing the `id` of the questions to be required to the `required_questions` argument in `sd_server()`, like

```{r}
sd_server(
  required_questions = c("vehicle_ownership", "penguins_other") # <1>
)
```

1. The `required_questions` argument takes a vector of question `id`s that you want to make required.

This will make the respondent unable to proceed until they have answered the required questions. It will also place a red asterisk (*) next to the question label to indicate that the question is required.

You can also make all questions required by setting `all_questions_required = TRUE` like this:

```{r}
sd_server(
  all_questions_required = TRUE
)
```

## Starting page 

When editing your survey, it can be helpful to start the survey at a specific page. You can define the starting page with the `start_page` argument in the `sd_server()` function, like this:

```{r}
sd_server(
  start_page = "page_id"
)
```

## Auto scroll

The auto scroll feature allows the page to automatically scroll according to the user's working progress and is enabled by default.

```{r}
sd_server(
  auto_scroll = TRUE # Change to FALSE to switch it off.
)
```

## Rating question

You may want to add a rating question by the end of the survey to collect user reflections. Simply set `rate_survey` to `TRUE` (Default to `FALSE`):

```{r}
sd_server(
  rate_survey = TRUE
)
```

Survey rating is triggered by the "Exit Survey" button by the end of the survey. If you want to implement the survey rating, make sure you define the Exit Button by the end of the survey using the `sd_close()` function, and then define `rate_survey = TRUE` in `sd_server()`.

Below are the `TRUE` and `FALSE` cases for `rate_survey`:

## `TRUE`

If `rate_survey` is `TRUE`, a survey rating question will pop up:

<img src="../images/screenshots/rate_survey.gif" style="max-width: 550px; width: 100%;">
</center>

## `FALSE`

If `rate_survey` is `FALSE`, a confirm exit dialog box will pop up:

<img src="../images/screenshots/confirm_exit.gif" style="max-width: 550px; width: 100%;">
</center>

## System translations

To systematically display the preset system messages and button text elements in a different language, change the system language using a different country code (default is `"en"` for English).

For example, to use Spanish use:

```{r}
sd_server(
  language = "es"
)
```

Five languages are supported by default, but you can customize the messages to any language (or any message) you want. See the [System Translations](system-translations.qmd) page for more details.

## Cookies

Cookies are used to store user sessions, including their session ID, survey data storage (backend), and their survey progress (frontend).

By default, the cookies are enabled. You can disable the cookies by setting `cookies = FALSE` in the `sd_server()` function, like this:

```{r}
sd_server(
  cookies = FALSE
)
```
