This page discusses how to create pages and navigate between them in a surveydown survey.

## Defining pages

In surveydown, pages are defined using fences (`:::`), like this:

```{r}
::: {.sd_page id=page1}

Page 1 content here

:::

::: {.sd_page id=page2}

Page 2 content here

:::
```

We use three colon symbols `:::`, called a "fence", to mark the start and end of pages. This notation is commonly used in Quarto for a variety of use cases, like defining [subfigures](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#subfigures) in images.

In the starting fence, you need to define the class as `.sd_page` and provide a page id (e.g. `welcome` and `page2` in the example above). Then anything you put between the page fences will appear on that page.

If you are using RStudio, you can also make use of the page gadget to create pages under the "Addins" dropdown menu. You can easily link the gadget with a keyboard shortcut from the "Tools" menu. Check out [this blog post](/blog/2025-04-08-surveydown-gadgets/) for a detailed walkthrough.

Here is what the **Survey Page Gadget** looks like in RStudio:

## Adding navigation buttons

To navigate to the next page, you need to insert a `sd_next()` function call inside a code chunk, like this: 

```{r}
#| echo: fenced

sd_next()
```

The above code chunk will create a "Next" button that goes on to the immediate next page. The button will look like this:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false

sd_next()
```

You can also provide an alternative label on the next page button using the `label` argument, like this:

```{r}
#| echo: fenced

sd_next(label = "Go to the next page")
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false

sd_next(label = "Go to the next page")
```

## Skipping Forward

### Direct Forward Skipping

You can send the survey respondent to other forward pages by changing the value assigned to the `next_page` argument in the `sd_next()` function. For example, to send the user to a page with the id `page3`, you can use:

```{r}
#| echo: fenced

sd_next(next_page = 'page3')
```
