```

There are three different ways to define questions in a surveydown survey:

1. **Using `sd_question()`**: Inside your `survey.qmd` file, add a code chunk, and use the `sd_question()` function.
1. **Using a YAML File**: Define question content in a `questions.yml` file and refer to them in the `survey.qmd` file using `sd_question()`.
1. **Using a GUI in RStudio**: In RStudio, `surveydown` include a simple GUI for creating questions.

The sections below describes each approach in greater detail.

## Using `sd_question()`

The most typical approach to define survey questions is to use the `sd_question()` function inside code chunks in your `survey.qmd` file.

The question type is defined by the `type` argument, and each question requires a unique `id` and a `label`.

Here's a simple example of a **multiple-choice** question:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Code

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
sd_question(
  id    = "favorite_penguin",
  type  = "mc",
  label = "Which type of penguin do you like the best?",
  option = c(
    "Adélie"    = "adelie",
    "Chinstrap" = "chinstrap",
    "Gentoo"    = "gentoo"
  )
)
```

## Output

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
sd_question(
  id    = 'penguins',
  type  = 'mc',
  label = "Which is your favorite type of penguin?",
  option = c(
    'Adélie'    = 'adelie',
    'Chinstrap' = 'chinstrap',
    'Gentoo'    = 'gentoo'
  )
)
```

::: {.callout-tip}

Note that either `option` or `options` can be used as the argument name for specifying the choices. If both are used, `option` takes precedence.

The standard way of defining options is to use the `c("Label" = "value")` format, where the left side is the label shown to respondents, and the right side is the internal value stored in the survey results.

The short-hand format `c("Label 1", "Label 2")` is also supported, in which case the values will be stored as they are.

Different question types require different arguments. For example, a **text input** question is much simpler:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Code

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
sd_question(
  id    = "phone_brand",
  type  = "text",
  label = "What is the brand of your phone?"
)
```

## Output

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
sd_question(
  id    = "phone_brand",
  type  = "text",
  label = "What is the brand of your phone?"
)
```

You can find more question types and their specific parameters in the [Question Types](question-types.html) documentation.

## Using a YAML File

You can provide all of the question meta data (id, type, label, and option) inside a `questions.yml` to define your survey questions. 

The purpose of using YAML files for question definition is to make it easier to re-use questions across surveys. When a surveydown survey is run, it renders all the survey content into a `_survey` folder. Inside that folder you will find a `questions.yml` file with all of the questions in the survey. This file will always get generated. You can then copy this file over to another survey to more easily re-use the questions.  

### Using Default `questions.yml`

1. Create a file named `questions.yml` in your project root directory (or copy it from another survey's `_survey` folder).
2. Define any other questions you want using the YAML format.
3. Insert questions in your `survey.qmd` file using `sd_question("id")` function, matching the `"id"` to each question you want to insert from the `questions.yml` file.

Here's a simple example of how a question is defined in `questions.yml`:

```{yaml}
favorite_penguin:
  type: mc
  label: Which type of penguin do you like the best?
  options:
    Adélie: adelie
    Chinstrap: chinstrap
    Gentoo: gentoo
```

The first name is the `id` for the question. In your `survey.qmd` file, you can insert the question using `sd_question()` with this `id`, like this:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

sd_question("favorite_penguin")
```

This approach can make your `survey.qmd` file more streamlined in appearance as each question will be defined by one line of code calling `sd_question("id")`


### Using Custom YAML Files

You can also specify a different YAML file using the `yml` parameter:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
sd_question(
  id = "age",
  yml = "questions/demographics.yml"
)
```

In the above example, you can see the `"age"` question is grabbed from the `demographics.yml` file in the `questions/` directory.

This flexibility allows you to organize questions into multiple files or directories for more complex surveys.

## Using a GUI in RStudio

::: {.callout-note}

We made a blog post explaining the GUI features in full detail [here](/blog/2025-04-08-surveydown-gadgets/).

:::

The `surveydown` package includes two gadgets inside the RStudio IDE to provide a user-friendly interface to define survey questions. You can access this feature by clicking the "Add Question" button in the RStudio toolbar when editing your `survey.qmd` file. There's another gadget for defining pages.

### Using the Question Gadget

The Survey Question Gadget provides a simple form to create a new question:

1. Use the Addins menu to select "Add Question"
2. Fill in the following:
   - **Question Type**: Select from the dropdown (default is "Multiple Choice")
   - **Question ID**: Enter a unique identifier (no spaces)
   - **Question Label**: Enter the actual question text
3. Select whether you need the R chunk option
4. Click "Create Question" or press Enter

The gadget will insert the properly formatted question code at your cursor position, which you can then customize further as needed.

### Setting Up Keyboard Shortcuts

You can make it easier to trigger the gadget by binding it to a keyboard shortcut.

1. Go to Tools → Addins → Browse Addins...

  <br>
  <center>
  <img src="/images/screenshots/shortcut_1.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;">
  </center>
  <br>

2. In the Addins popup window, click on the "Keyboard shortcuts..." button on the bottom left corner.

  <br>
  <center>
  <img src="/images/screenshots/shortcut_2.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
  </center>
  <br>

3. Input "survey" in the search box.

  <br>
  <center>
  <img src="/images/screenshots/shortcut_3.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
  </center>
  <br>

4. Assign whatever shortcuts you want, e.g.:
    - `Ctrl+Shift+P` for the Survey Page Gadget
    - `Ctrl+Shift+Q` for the Survey Question Gadget
