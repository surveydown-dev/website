    "text": "Programmatically generate survey questions\nYou can use  code to programmatically generate survey questions in your survey.qmd file, which can be useful if you have a large number of questions that are similar to each other. One way to do this is to first create a data frame with the question parameters, and then use the sd_question() function to create the questions.\nHere’s an example using map() over the items data frame to generate a list of questions. Note that the list of questions is wrapped in shiny::tagList(), which is necessary for the survey to render properly since the map() function returns a list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis approach inserts all the questions on the same page. We haven’t found a way to insert these questions on different pages, which would require more sophistication in the map() function.\n\n\n\n\nCode chunk\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n```{r}\n# Generate data frame of question parameters\nitems &lt;- tibble::tibble(\n  type = \"mc\",\n  id = as.character(1:3),\n  label = LETTERS[1:3],\n  option = list(c(\n    \"None\" = \"0\", \n    \"A Little\" = \"1\",\n    \"A lot\" = \"2\"\n  ))\n)\n\n# Generate questions\nshiny::tagList(\n  purrr::map(1:nrow(items), function(i) {\n    args &lt;- items[i, ]\n    sd_question(\n      id     = as.character(args$id),\n      type   = args$type,\n      label  = args$label,\n      option = unlist(args$option)\n    )\n  })\n)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\nNone\n\n\n\n\nA Little\n\n\n\n\nA lot\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nB\n\n\n\n\nNone\n\n\n\n\nA Little\n\n\n\n\nA lot\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n\nNone\n\n\n\n\nA Little\n\n\n\n\nA lot\n\n\n\n\n*",

    "text": "The survey.qmd file\nThe survey.qmd file is where you define the main survey content of your survey, such as pages, questions, and navigation buttons. It is a standard Quarto document, so you can use markdown (or the RStudio visual editor) to insert text, images, etc. just like you would in any Quarto document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou do NOT need to render the survey.qmd file, and in fact we do not recommend doing so as the rendered output will not necessarily look like your final survey. Instead, to preview your survey you should locally run your app.\n\n\nYAML header\nThe YAML header is at the top of the survey.qmd file. It contains some basic settings, like this:\n---\nformat: html\necho: false\nwarning: false\n---\nThe only required setting is format: html, as the document should render as an HTML document. The other settings are optional, though we recommend you keep them to ensure a good experience for your respondents. Typically you wouldn’t want warnings or the code defining the survey questions to be displayed in your survey - that’s what the echo: false and warning: false settings are for.\nChanging the look and feel\nBecause the survey.qmd is a Quarto document, you can use any of the Quarto formatting options to change the look and feel of your survey.\nFor example, you can change the overall survey theme using the theme key:\n---\ntheme: united # Any bootswatch theme \n---\nThere are 25 bootswatch themes to choose from. You can also provide a custom.scss file to further modify the theme, or even combine the two, e.g.:\n---\ntheme: [united, custom.scss]\n---\nProgress bar\nYou can modify the survey progress bar with the barcolor and barposition keys, e.g.:\n---\nbarcolor: \"#768692\"\nbarposition: top \n---\nThe barcolor key defines the color of the progress bar. It defaults to the primary theme color, but you can change it to any hex code you wish here to overwrite the theme color.\nThe barposition key defines the position of the progress bar. It defaults to top, but can also be changed to bottom or none (to remove the bar). The progress bar updates on every question the user clicks on, not pages.\nThe rest of the content in the survey.qmd file is the content you want in your survey, including pages, navigation buttons, and questions.\nAdding pages\nIn surveydown, pages are defined using fences (:::), like this:\n\n::: {#welcome .sd-page}\n\nPage 1 content here\n\n:::\n\n::: {#page2 .sd-page}\n\nPage 2 content here\n\n:::\n\nAs you can see, we use three colon symbols :::, called a “fence”, to mark the start and end of pages. This notation is commonly used in Quarto for a variety of use cases, like defining subfigures in images.\nIn the starting fence, you need to define a page name (e.g. welcome and page2 in the example above) and you need to define the class as .sd-page. Then anything you put between the page fences will appear on that page.\nAdding navigation buttons\nTo navigate to the next page, you need to insert a sd_next() function call inside a code chunk, like this:\n\n```{r}\nsd_next()\n```\n\nThe above code chunk will create a “Next” button that goes on to the immediate next page. The button will look like this:\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\nYou can also send the user to other pages by just changing the value assigned to the next_page argument. For example, to send the user to a page with the id page3, you can use:\n\n```{r}\nsd_next(next_page = 'page3')\n```\n\nFinally, you can also change the label of the button by changing the label argument, like this:\n\n```{r}\nsd_next(label = 'Next page')\n```\n\n\n\n\nNext page\n\n\n\nAdding questions\nEvery survey question is created using the sd_question() function inside a code chunk. The question type is defined by the type argument. For example, to add a multiple choice question, you could insert the following code chunk:\n\n```{r}\nsd_question(\n  type  = 'mc',\n  id    = 'penguins',\n  label = \"Which is your favorite type of penguin?\",\n  option = c(\n    'Adélie'    = 'adelie',\n    'Chinstrap' = 'chinstrap',\n    'Gentoo'    = 'gentoo'\n  )\n)\n```\n\nThe above code chunk will create a multiple choice question that looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nWhich is your favorite type of penguin?\n\n\n\n\nAdélie\n\n\n\n\nChinstrap\n\n\n\n\nGentoo\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nThe sd_question() function can be used to create a variety of question types, like text input, select drop down choices, and more by changing the type argument (see the Questions Types page).\nThe function has many other arguments for customizing the look and feel of the question, such as the height and width (see the Question Formatting page).\nBy default all questions are optional, but you can make questions required in the server options (see the Server Options page for details).\nEnding the survey\nThe simplest way to end a survey is to create a page with no sd_next() button on it. This will effectively serve as a ending page, because the respondent will not be able to navigate anywhere else once reaching a page with no next button.\nFor example, you may want to have a screen-out page that respondents are sent to if they answer a certain way on a question (e.g., see conditional skipping. You can do this by creating a page with no sd_next() button on it, like this:\n\n::: {#screenout .sd-page}\n\nSorry, you are not eligible for this survey.\n\nYou can close this window now.\n\n:::\n\nWhen a respondent reaches this page, they will not be able to navigate anywhere else, so the survey is over.\nYou can also add a button to end the survey programmatically using the sd_close() function inside a code chunk, like this:\n\n```{r}\nsd_close(label = 'Close window')\n```\n\nThis will create a button with the label “Close window” that the respondent can click on to close the survey window. This button can be added anywhere in the survey, not necessarily on the last page - all it does is close the browser window.\nFinally, you can also add a button to end the survey and redirect the respondent to another page. You can do this using the sd_redirect() function, like this:\n\n\nCode chunk\nOutput\n\n\n\n\nsd_redirect(\n  id     = \"redirect\",\n  url    = \"https://www.google.com\",\n  label  = \"Redirect to Google\",\n  button = TRUE,\n  newtab = TRUE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedirect to Google\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will create a button with the label “Redirect to Google” that the respondent can click on to be redirected to Google. You can also customize the url to include url parameters. See the External Redirects page for more details.",

It is where you can set custom control logic and other configuration options, such as conditional display logic with the sd_show_if() function, or conditional skip logic with the sd_skip_if() function.\nIf you create a new survey using a template, the server() function looks like this:\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n\n  # Define conditional skip logic (skip to page if a condition is true)\n  sd_skip_if()\n\n  # Define conditional display logic (show a question if a condition is true)\n  sd_show_if()\n\n  # Main server to control the app\n  sd_server(db = db)\n\n}\n\nThe sd_server() function at the bottom makes everything run.

    "section": "Reactive Redirect",
    "text": "Reactive Redirect\nReactive redirect is essentially useful if you deploy your survey on survey panels like Prolific or Dynata. These survey panels usually use different IDs to identify survey respondents.\nTo make reactive redirect work, you need to edit both in your server chunk, and your survey body. We’ll use an example to explain the process. This is the same example in our demo survey.\nFirstly, in your server chunk, define url_normal. It is an reactive expression in Shiny apps. You’ll use the sd_get_url_pars() function to retrieve all the parameters in your survey URL, and concatenate with customized texts including id names, status values, etc. In this example, we defined 3 IDs: id_a, id_b, and id_c, which should be grabbed from your survey link.\n\n# Reactive expression that generates a url for a normal ending\nurl_normal &lt;- reactive({\n  params &lt;- sd_get_url_pars()\n  id_a &lt;- params[\"id_a\"]\n  id_b &lt;- params[\"id_b\"]\n  id_c &lt;- params[\"id_c\"]\n  return(paste0(\n    \"https://www.google.com?id_a=\", id_a,\n    \"&id_b=\", id_b,\n    \"&id_c=\", id_c,\n    \"&status=0\" # status of 0 indicates normal ending\n})\n\nSecondly, also in your server chunk, create the redirect button using sd_redirect(). Note that we passed url_normal() value, with a pair of parentheses, to the url parameter.\n\n# Create the redirect button for normal ending\nsd_redirect(\n  id = \"redirect_normal\",\n  url = url_normal(),\n  button = TRUE,\n  label = \"Redirect with Normal Status\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that we created url_normal, and then passed url_normal() to sd_redirect(). This is how Shiny app deals with reactivity. Here url_normal is created by reactive() and is called “reactive expression”. url_normal() is a string value containing the concatenated URL. In other words, the url_normal() value is the result of the url_normal expression.\n\n\nFinally, in your survey body, output this redirect_normal URL using the sd_output() function:\n\n# Put this in the desired place of your survey body\nsd_output(\"redirect_normal\")\n\nAfter all these are done, your sd_output() function will generate a button that redirects you to this link:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/?id_a=a123id_b=b234id_c=c345&status=0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCount-down delay (only applies for static redirect):\n\n# count-down of 10 seconds\nsd_redirect(\n  # previous parameters...\n  delay  = 10\n)\n\nOpen at a new tab (applies for both static and reactive):\n\nsd_redirect(\n  # previous parameters...\n  newtab  = TRUE\n)\n\nIf newtab is used together with delay, the new tab opened after count-down might be blocked by the browser. We’ve tested it with Safari and Edge. It worked fine on Safari, but Edge blocks it with a pop-up notice.",

    "text": "Live randomization\nOne approach is to generate the random labels in the server function “live”, meaning that the labels will be generated when the survey is first loaded. For example, let’s say in my server function I generate three random numbers between 1 and 100 and use them to create the option labels for a multiple choice question:\n\n# Create a vector of options\nq1_options &lt;- c('option 1', 'option 2', 'option 3')\n\n# Randomly sample 3 labels from 1 to 100\nq1_labels &lt;- sample(seq(100), 3) \n\n# Assign the labels to the options\nnames(q1_options) &lt;- q1_labels \n\nq1_options\n\n#&gt;         49         65         25 \n#&gt; \"option 1\" \"option 2\" \"option 3\"\n\n\nRemember that the names of the vector are the labels, so the respondents will see the numbers in the names of the above vector, and the values ('option1', etc.) will be stored in the resulting survey data.\nTo then use these options in a multiple choice question, you would use the sd_question() function also in the server function (not in the survey.qmd file) like this:\n\nsd_question(\n  id = \"q1\",\n  type = \"mc\",  \n  label = \"Which of these numbers is the largest?\",\n  option = q1_options\n)\n\nBy defining this question inside the server function, the question will be created as a reactive question that can then be displayed in the survey.qmd file using the sd_output() function, like this:\n\n```{r}\nsd_output(id = \"q1\", type = \"question\")\n```\n\nOne important caveat to this approach is that the random numbers that are generated are not automatically stored in the survey data (because they are generated live). If you needed to store the random numbers, you can use the sd_store_value() function, like this:\n\nsd_store_value(q1_labels, id = \"q1_labels\")\n\nThis would store the numbers in the q1_labels column of the survey data, which would be concatenated into the single string: 49, 65, 25.\nYou could alternatively use the sd_store_value() function to store each of the random numbers in separate columns, like this:\n\nsd_store_value(q1_labels[1], id = \"q1_label_1\")\nsd_store_value(q1_labels[2], id = \"q1_label_2\")\nsd_store_value(q1_labels[3], id = \"q1_label_3\")",

Here the only thing you would need to keep track of the randomly chosen row id:\n\n# Read in the design file\ndesign &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"design.csv\")\n\n# Randomly choose a row id\nq1_id &lt;- sample(design$id, 1)\n\n# Store the chosen row id in the survey data (here q1_id will be the column name)\nsd_store_value(q1_id) \n\n# Filter the design to get the chosen row\nnumbers &lt;- design |&gt; \n  filter(id == q1_id) |&gt; \n  pull(numbers)\n\n# Create the options\nq1_options &lt;- c('option 1', 'option 2', 'option 3')\nnames(q1_options) &lt;- numbers\n\n# Create the reactive question\nsd_question(\n  id = \"q1\",\n  type = \"mc\",  \n  label = \"Which of these numbers is the largest?\",\n  option = q1_options\n)\n\nOnce again, you would be able to then display this question in the survey.qmd file using the sd_output() function:\n\n```{r}\nsd_output(id = \"q1\", type = \"question\")\n```",

However, you may also want to fetch the data in a reactive context (i.e. in your survey). For example, perhaps you want to show respondents a bar chart of the most common responses to a question. The sd_get_data() function is compatible with reactive fetching as well - just call it inside the server() function in your app.R file:\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n\n  data &lt;- sd_get_data(db)\n\n  sd_server()\n\n}\n\nNow the data object will be a reactive expression, not a data.frame. To use it, you have to call it with () to get the latest data as a data.frame. For example:\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n\n  data &lt;- sd_get_data(db, refresh_interval = 5)\n\n  output$my_plot &lt;- renderPlot({  \n    my_data &lt;- data()\n    # insert code here to make a plot with my_data\n  })\n\n  sd_server()\n\n}\n\nHere the my_data object will be a data.frame with the latest data from your database, refreshed every 5 sections according to the refresh_interval parameter (5 seconds is the default value), which you could then use to make a plot.\nIn this example, the output$my_plot object will be a plot, which you can then display in your survey by placing plotOutput(\"my_plot\") in a code chunk somewhere in your survey.qmd file.\nSee the Reactivity page for more information on how to use reactivity in your survey.",

    "text": "Why is my survey app so slow when starting?\nWhen a {surveydown} survey first runs, it checks for files in a _survey folder that contain the rendered content from your survey.qmd file. If any of those files are missing or if changes have been detected in your survey.qmd or app.R files, it will re-render your survey, which can take a bit longer. But this only happens once, and afterwards so long as no further changes have been made to your survey files the app will use the saved content in the _survey folder to launch, which should load almost instantly. So if your app launches slowly, just close it and launch it again and you should immediately load. If you still see a slow launch, consider posting an issue to let us know that something might be wrong.\nAlso, it is important that you run your survey locally at least once before deploying it live. This will render all your survey content into the _survey folder, which will also get uploaded when you deploy it."

The password defined by sd_db_config() should be the same as your Supabase project password. Access the Storing Data page for how to set all Supabase credentials. Then, make sure your survey runs on your local machine and can successfully link with your Supabase project table. With these confirmed, your shinyapps deployment should work without problem.\nIf you still encounter an error (e.g., the page shows the app failed to start, or you see the page but it doesn’t run properly), try clearing your cache. The simplest way to do so is to reboot your computer. It may also help if you delete previously generated files, such as the survey.html file if you rendered it and the rsconnect folder. After re-rendering, you should be able to deploy the app without error."

This is useful for conditional reactive questions defined in the server.\nWe added a new sd_completion_code() function that generates a random completion code for your survey.\nWe added a new sd_close() function to make a button that closes the survey.\n\nStefan Munnes added a translation feature that allows you to customize the system messages in the app to any language you want.\nWe modified how data handling is done so that each respondent’s state in the survey can be restored via cookies if they refresh the browser window or close and re-open the window. Before, respondents would be sent back to the start of the survey and a new entry in the database would be created, so this features allows respondents to pause and come back to the survey without that happening.\nWe added two new helper functions, sd_add_question() and sd_add_page(), that make it easier to quickly create template questions and pages.

    "section": "Performance improvements",
    "text": "Performance improvements\nOne major improvement we’ve made is to streamline how the survey.qmd file is updating. Before you needed to render the survey.qmd file yourself before running the app.R file, but now you actually never need to render it. All rendering is handled when you run the shiny app via the app.R file.\nAnd this rendering is “smart” too - it renders the survey.qmd file into an html file, then it parses that file for all of the content needed for the survey and stores each piece in a _survey folder. This folder is then what the shiny app uses to load the survey. If no changes are detected in the survey.qmd file or any of the components in the _survey folder, then the app will always load content from the pre-rendered content in the _survey folder, which will load nearly instantaneously! Only if you make a change to your survey will it be re-rendered, and again once that rendering is done once it won’t run again until another change is detected. This results in a much more efficient app that loads nearly instantaneously.\nWe also improved the database updating to be much more efficient. It used to run a write operation to the database on every single question ineraction, but that slowed down the app significantly. Now that we have cookies enabled, we do the immediate record keeping in the cookies and only write to the database when the respondent closes the survey or turns the page. This is a more reasonable compromise that makes the app feel snappy while still ensuring that the data is saved even if the respondent accidentally closes the window."

In this post, I’m going to show you one approach for using surveydown to create a particular type of complex survey: a choice-based conjoint survey.\nThe key component of a choice-based conjoint survey is asking repsondents to make choices from randomized sets of choice questions. So the hard part is figuring out a way to show each respondent a different set of randomized questions. This post shows how you can achieve this in surveydown.\nThroughout this post, I will use a demo survey about people’s preferences for apples with three attributes: type, price, and freshness.1\nYou can view the live demo survey here, and all files used to create the survey are on this GitHub repo."

The logic controlling the conditional display and skipping is defined with the sd_skip_if() function in the app.R file.\nNone of this is necessary for a conjoint survey, but often times these are features that you may want to include, such as screening people out of the survey if they don’t qualify to take it, so we include it for demonstration purposes."

    "section": "Implementing the choice questions",
    "text": "Implementing the choice questions\nThe choice questions are implemented at the top of the server() function in the app.R file in the demo repo. This code does the following steps:\n1. Read in the design file\nPretty straightforward - this is one line to read in the choice_questions.csv design file that we saved in the project folder.\n\ndesign &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"choice_questions.csv\")\n\n2. Sample and store a random respondent ID\nSince we want each respondent to see a different set of choice questions, we randomly sample a respondent ID from the set of all respondent IDs in the design file. We also need to keep track of this and store it in our response data so that later we can know what each respondent was actually shown.\nSince this is a value that we generated in the server (and not a value from a survey question to a respondent), we have to manually add it to the survey response data using sd_store_value(). Here we modified the name so that in the resulting survey data the column name will be \"respID\".\n\n# Sample a random respondentID\nrespondentID &lt;- sample(design$respID, 1)\n\n# Store the respondentID\nsd_store_value(respondentID, \"respID\")\n\n3. Filter the design for the respondentID\nWe create a subset dataframe called df that stores only the rows for the randomly chosen respondent ID. We also append the \"images/\" string onto the values in the image column as this will create the relative path to the images in our survey, e.g. \"images/fuji.jpg\" (all the images we show are in the \"images\" folder in the repo).\n\n# Filter for the rows for the chosen respondentID\ndf &lt;- design %&gt;%\n  filter(respID == respondentID) %&gt;%\n  mutate(image = paste0(\"images/\", image))\n\n4. Define a function to create question options\nThis is the most complex component in the server logic. Here we created a function that takes a dataframe and returns a named vector defining the options to show in each choice question. In this case, we only have 3 options per choice question, so each time we call this function we will use a small dataframe that has just 3 rows defining the 3 choice alternatives in a single choice question.\nThe function does several things. First, it extracts three single-row data frames that store the values of each of the 3 alternatives (alt1, alt2, and alt3). It then creates an options vector that has just 3 values: \"option_1\", \"option_2\", and \"option_3\". Then we have to define the names of each of those options. Remember that the values in the options vector are what gets stored in our resulting survey data based on what the respondent chooses, but the names are what respondents see. So in the context of a choice survey like this, we need to embed all of the attributes and their levels in the names of the options vector.\nWe use the glue() function to easily inject the values stored in alt1, alt2, and alt3 into our labels. The glue() function is similar to paste() in that is just concatenates object values into a string, but it has an easier syntax to work with. Anything inside {} brackets is evaluated, and the resulting value is inserted into the string. So for example, the line glue(\"1 plus 1 equals {1+1}\") would produce the string \"1 plus 1 equals 2\".\nIn our case, we’re including some html code to insert an image of the apple type (&lt;img src='{alt1$image}' width=100&gt;), the apply type itself (**Type**: {alt1$type}), and the apple price (**Price**: $ {alt1$price} / lb).\nNotice also that we’re mixing markdown (e.g. **Option 1**) and html (e.g. &lt;br&gt;), which will all get rendered into proper html in the resulting shiny app. The full function looks like this:\n\n# Function to create the labels for a choice question\n# based on the values in df\n\nmake_cbc_options &lt;- function(df) {\n  alt1 &lt;- df |&gt; filter(altID == 1)\n  alt2 &lt;- df |&gt; filter(altID == 2)\n  alt3 &lt;- df |&gt; filter(altID == 3)\n\n  options &lt;- c(\"option_1\", \"option_2\", \"option_3\")\n\n  names(options) &lt;- c(\n    glue(\"\n      **Option 1**&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;img src='{alt1$image}' width=100&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      **Type**: {alt1$type}&lt;br&gt;\n      **Price**: $ {alt1$price} / lb\n    \"),\n    glue(\"\n      **Option 2**&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;img src='{alt2$image}' width=100&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      **Type**: {alt2$type}&lt;br&gt;\n      **Price**: $ {alt2$price} / lb\n    \"),\n    glue(\"\n      **Option 3**&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;img src='{alt3$image}' width=100&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      **Type**: {alt3$type}&lt;br&gt;\n      **Price**: $ {alt3$price} / lb\n    \")\n  )\n  return(options)\n}\n\n5. Create the options for each choice question\nOne of the benefits of making the function the way we did in the previous step is that we can now easily call it to generate the option vector for each of the 6 choice questions in df:\n\n# Create the options for each choice question\n\ncbc1_options &lt;- make_cbc_options(df |&gt; filter(qID == 1))\ncbc2_options &lt;- make_cbc_options(df |&gt; filter(qID == 2))\ncbc3_options &lt;- make_cbc_options(df |&gt; filter(qID == 3))\ncbc4_options &lt;- make_cbc_options(df |&gt; filter(qID == 4))\ncbc5_options &lt;- make_cbc_options(df |&gt; filter(qID == 5))\ncbc6_options &lt;- make_cbc_options(df |&gt; filter(qID == 6))\n\n6. Create each choice question (6 in total)\nFinally, we now have everything we need to generate each choice question. Here we’re using the mc_buttons question type so that the labels we generated will be displayed on a large button, which looks good both on a computer and phone. We give the question a unique id (e.g. cbc_q1), and a label, and then set the option to the corresponding option vector we defined above.\n\nsd_question(\n  type   = 'mc_buttons',\n  id     = 'cbc_q1',\n  label  = \"(1 of 6) If these were your only options, which would you choose?\",\n  option = cbc1_options\n)\n\n# ...and 5 more questions like this\n\nRemember that since the labels in the options are being dynamically generated on each new session (each respondent), they have to be created in the server, not in the main survey body. As a result, the sd_question() function must also be created in the server code (if you put this code in the main body, only one random set of choice options will be generated, and they’ll be the same for everyone).\nTo display each question in the survey body, we use sd_output(\"id\", type = \"question\"), changing id to each corresponding choice question we created. In the demo survey.qmd file, you’ll see that there are 6 choice questions displayed in the main survey body (each on their own page), and each of those 6 questions are defined in the server() function in the app.R file.\nWhen rendered, a choice question will look like this, with the values matching whatever alternative was chosen in the design file:\n\n\n\n\n(1 of 6) If these were your only options, which would you choose? *\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 1Type: HoneycrispPrice: $ 1 / lb\n\n\n\n\nOption 2Type: FujiPrice: $ 3 / lb\n\n\n\n\nOption 3Type: Red DeliciousPrice: $ 2.5 / lb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that’s it! You now have 6 randomized choice questions!"

You can test your survey even without having it connected to a database by setting ignore = TRUE in the sd_database() function. Of course, you probably should also test it after connecting it to a database to ensure that responses are being properly stored.\nWhen testing, you might get an error - don’t panic!

    "text": "Why surveydown?\nMost survey platforms (e.g., Google forms, Qualtrics, etc.) use graphic interfaces or spreadsheets to define survey content, making version control, collaboration, and reproducibility difficult or impossible. The surveydown package was designed to address these problems. As an open-source, markdown-based platform, all survey content is defined using plain text (markdown and R code) in two files:\n\nsurvey.qmd: A Quarto document that contains the survey content (pages, questions, etc).\napp.R: An R script defining a shiny app that contains global settings (libraries, database configuration, etc.) and server configuration options (e.g., conditional skipping / display, etc.).\n\nThis approach makes your survey easy to reproduce, share, and version control with common tools like Git. And since all survey data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, you have total control over where your survey data lives. We provide direct support for Supabase as a free, secure, and easy to use option.\nIn case you’re interested in the background behind the project, this blog post provides something of an origin story. Note that the design discussed in the post is now quite outdated with what ultimately became surveydown."

    "section": "Reactivity",
    "text": "Reactivity\nOne other feature that is particularly powerful is the ability to use R code in your survey via Shiny’s reactive programming. This allows you to make your survey more interactive and to use the full power of R to create custom functionality.\nDemo 1: Displaying content based on previous responses\nLet’s say you wanted to create a survey that asked the respondent’s name, and then displayed a personalized message based on their name. You could do this by first asking their name:\n\nsd_question(\n  type  = \"text\",\n  id    = \"name\",\n  label = \"What is your name?\"\n)\n\nThen you can use the sd_display_value(\"name\") function to display the value of the name question in other parts of your survey. For example:\n\nWelcome, `r sd_display_value(\"name\")`!\n\nWhich would render as something like “Welcome, Dave!” (assuming the respondent entered “Dave” in the name question). This works because the sd_display_value() function is reactive, meaning it will update the display based on the respondent’s responses.\nDemo 2: Displaying randomized question labels\nLet’s say you wanted to show a series of questions, but you wanted to randomize the labels shown for each question. You could do this by first defining a list of labels, and then using the sd_question_reactive() function to create a question that will display a random label from the list.\nFor example, let’s ask the respondent to rate different car brands from a random set of brands. You could first pre-define the randomized sets of brands for each respondent and store it as a csv file, like this:\n\nbrands &lt;- c(\"Toyota\", \"Ford\", \"Chevrolet\", \"Honda\", \"Nissan\", \"Tesla\")\ndesign &lt;- data.frame(\n  respondent_id = rep(1:10, each = 3),\n  brand = unlist(lapply(1:10, function(x) sample(brands, 3, replace = FALSE)))\n)\nwrite_csv(design, \"design.csv\")\n\nThis would make a design file that looks like this:\n\n\n#&gt;   respondent_id     brand\n#&gt; 1             1     Honda\n#&gt; 2             1     Tesla\n#&gt; 3             1    Nissan\n#&gt; 4             2     Tesla\n#&gt; 5             2      Ford\n#&gt; 6             2 Chevrolet\n\n\nNote that this would not be done in your survey.qmd file - it’s just a one-time thing to create the design (probably stored in an R file).\nThen in your server code chunk, you could read in the design file and use it to randomize the labels for each question based on a randomly chosen respondent:\n\ndesign &lt;- read_csv(\"design.csv\")\nresp_id &lt;- sample(design$respondent_id, 1)\ndf_resp &lt;- design %&gt;% filter(respondent_id == resp_id)\n\noptions &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\nnames(options) &lt;- df_resp$brand\n\nsd_question_reactive(\n  type  = \"mc\",\n  id    = \"brands\",\n  label = \"Which of these brands do you like best?\",\n  option = options\n)\n\nHere the sd_question_reactive() function is used because the labels depend on the randomly chosen respondent. This means the labels will be different for each respondent.\nSince this is a reactive question, this code must be placed inside the server code chunk, not where you want it to appear in the survey. To define where in the survey the question should appear, you use the sd_display_question() function with the id set to the same value as the id in the sd_question_reactive() function, like this:\n\nsd_display_question(id = \"brands\")\n\nNow the brands question will be displayed in the survey where you put this code chunk.\nNote that all question responses are automatically saved to the database, but if you wanted to store some other value (e.g. the randomly chosen respondent_id), you could do that with the sd_store_value() function, like this:\n\nsd_store_value(resp_id)"

    "text": "Motivation\nIn the original conception of surveydown, the entire survey was defined in a single Quarto shiny document that would render into a shiny app. While this was a rather parsimonious design, it also had some flaws that weren’t immediately apparent.\nPerhaps the largest issue was page security (see this issue). With Quarto shiny documents, the qmd file is first rendered into a static html page that is then used to define the elements of the user interface in the resulting shiny app. This meant that for us to introduce pages, we relied on a combination of JS and CSS to hide and show the page divs based on users clicking on next buttons. While this resulted in a nice user experience, under the hood the entire app was still just one big html page with all of the content available.\nThis design meant that anyone could still see the source code to any component of the survey they wanted. A user could simply right-click and open “Inspect” then manually change the CSS of a page div from style=\"display: none;\" to style=\"display: show;\" and boom - the “page” would appear!\nThis was obviously a major security issue as pages with things like completion codes or redirect buttons at the end could be easily shown without going through the whole survey. The only solution was an architectural overhaul that would only show the content on one page at a time."

    "section": "New architecture",
    "text": "New architecture\nThe new architecture employs a two-file design composed of a survey and an app that renders to a traditional Shiny app:\n\n\nsurvey.qmd: A Quarto document that contains the survey content (pages, questions, etc), which renders to an HTML file.\n\napp.R: An R script defining a Shiny app that contains the global settings (libraries, database configuration, etc.) and server configuration options (e.g., conditional skipping / display, etc.).\n\nThese files must be named survey.qmd and app.R.\nThey typically look something like this:\n\n\nsurvey.qmd file\napp.R file\n\n\n\n\n---\nformat: html\necho: false\nwarning: false\n---\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(surveydown)\n```\n\n::: {#welcome .sd-page}\n\n# Welcome to our survey!\n\n```{r}\nsd_question(\n  type  = 'mc',\n  id    = 'penguins',\n  label = \"Which type of penguin do you like the best?\",\n  option = c(\n    'Adélie'    = 'adelie',\n    'Chinstrap' = 'chinstrap',\n    'Gentoo'    = 'gentoo'\n  )\n)\n\nsd_next(next_page = 'end')\n```\n\n:::\n\n::: {#end .sd-page}\n\nThis it the last page in the survey\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(surveydown)\n\ndb &lt;- sd_database(\n  host   = \"\",\n  dbname = \"\",\n  port   = \"\",\n  user   = \"\",\n  table  = \"\",\n  ignore = TRUE\n)\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n\n  # Define conditional skip logic here (skip to page if a condition is true)\n  sd_skip_if()\n\n  # Define  conditional display logic here (show a question if a condition is true)\n  sd_show_if()\n\n  # Main server to control the app\n  sd_server()\n}\n\nshiny::shinyApp(ui = sd_ui(), server = server)\n\n\n\n\nThis approach allows us to separate the survey content (in the survey.qmd file) from the survey logic (in the app.R file), which comes with a few benefits:\n\n\nSecurity: Since the rendered survey content is no longer directly embedded in the app as a single html page, it makes it much harder for users to tamper with the content. Only the content on one page at a time will be rendered by the server.\n\nClarity: With two files, it is now clearer where the survey content versus control logic should be defined. Before, all of the server logic was in a single server code chunk at the end of the survey.qmd file, which required the user to scroll up and down to edit the server logic versus the survey content. Now a user can have both files open in two tabs in an IDE and more easily edit the survey content and server content.\n\nSimplicity: The new design eliminates the need for a Quarto extension to render the survey. This allows us to ship all of the core functionality of surveydown as a single R package, which is installed globally on your system.\n\nThe updated documentation of the Survey Components page reflects this new design."

    "text": "New page architecture\nThe motivation to secure the page content led to a totally new approach to designing the survey pages. Our new approach actually renders the survey.qmd into a static html page and then parses it into a list of page objects. Each page object is itself a list of elements, including the page ID, question IDs, etc., as well as the rendered html content for that page.\nThe sd_server() function then uses this list of page objects to display one page at a time via a shiny::renderUI() function into a single “main” output. This approach allowed us to control what content is being served, eliminating the ability of survey respondents to see anything other than the content on the current page.\nThis approach also gave us the opportunity to overhaul how pagination works in general. Previously, users had to add a sd_next(next_page = \"page_id\") button at the end of each page, making sure to specify the next page to go to. This was a bit annoying as most of the time you just want to go to the next page, so specifying it felt redundant. Now users can simply add sd_next() at the bottom of each page and the server will go to the next page by default. If you want to direct the respondent to a different page, then you specify the target page using sd_next(next_page = \"page_id\")."

    "text": "Improved conditional show and skip logic\nConditionally displaying questions or skipping to pages is a core logic that many surveys need. Our original approach was relatively clunky, so since we were already introducing many breaking designs, we figured we should overhaul the logic for conditional skipping and displaying.\nThe new approach uses just two functions: sd_skip_if() and sd_show_if(). These functions can be provided in the main server() function in the app.R file to define the conditions and targets for either conditional displaying a question or conditionally skipping to a page. The structure for each condition in these new functions is always as follows:\n\n&lt;condition&gt; ~ \"target_question_id\"\n\nAs an example, let’s say we want to show a question called \"penguins_other\" if the respondent chose the \"other\" option in a question called \"penguins\". We could do this with the following code in the app.R file:\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n\n  sd_show_if(\n    input$penguins == \"other\" ~ \"penguins_other\"\n  )\n\n  sd_server(db = db)\n\n}\n\nYou can provide multiple conditions to the sd_show_if() function, each separated by a comma. The sd_skip_if() function works the same way, but it will skip to a target page instead of showing a target question. See the revised Configuration Options page for more details on the new changes."

The structure for each condition in the sd_skip_if() function is always:\n\n&lt;condition&gt; ~ \"target_page_id\"\n\nIn the example above, input$vehicle_ownership == \"no\" is the condition, and \"screenout\" is the target page that the respondent will be sent to if the condition is met.",

    "text": "Common conditions\nBoth the sd_show_if() and sd_skip_if() functions require a condition that returns a logical value (TRUE or FALSE). The condition can be defined in a number of ways. In this section, we’ll highlight some of the most common types of conditions you might need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Demo of Conditional Display showcases how to use the sd_show_if() function with a variety of different conditions, but the same principles apply to conditions used in the sd_skip_if() function.\n\n\nConditioning on question answers\nOne of the most common situations is conditioning on the value of a single question or multiple questions, like this:\n\nsd_show_if(\n\n # Simple condition based on single question choice\n input$penguins1 == \"other\" ~ \"penguins1_other\",\n\n # Multiple condition based on multiple question choices\n input$penguins2 == \"other\" & input$show_other == \"show\" ~ \"penguins2_other\"\n\n)\n\nIn the first condition, the penguins1 question is checked to see if the respondent chose the \"other\" option. If they did, the penguins1_other question will be shown.\nIn the second condition, the penguins2 question is checked to see if the respondent chose the \"other\" option, and the show_other question is checked to see if the respondent chose the \"show\" option. With this condition, the penguins2_other question will only be shown if both conditions are TRUE.\nNumeric values\nAnother common condition is checking the value of a numeric question. To do so, you need to wrap the input$question_id in the as.numeric() function because all question values are stored as strings, like this:\n\nsd_show_if(\n as.numeric(input$car_number) &gt; 1 ~ \"car_ownership\"\n)\n\nIn the condition above, the car_number question is checked to see if the respondent chose a number greater than 1. If they did, the car_ownership question will be shown.\nMultiple response questions\nFor multiple response question types (e.g. mc_multiple), the question returns a vector storing all the chosen values. You can use this vector to check for different conditions, such as whether the chosen values are in some set of values using the %in% operator, or whether the respondent chose a number of options using the length() function, like this:\n\nsd_show_if(\n\n # Check if the respondent chose \"apple\", \"banana\", or both\n all(input$fav_fruits %in% c(\"apple\", \"banana\")) ~ \"apple_or_banana\",\n\n # Check if the respondent chose more than 3 fruits\n length(input$fav_fruits) &gt; 3 ~ \"fruit_number\"\n\n)\n\nIn the first example, the fav_fruits question is checked to see if the respondent chose \"apple\", \"banana\", or both; if so, the apple_or_banana question will be shown.\nIn the second example, the fav_fruits question is checked to see if the respondent chose more than 3 fruits; if so, the fruit_number question will be shown.\nConditioning on answered status\nYou may want to show a target question if a question is answered at all or not. To do this, we created the sd_is_answered() function that returns TRUE if a question is answered and FALSE otherwise.\nFor example, let’s say you had a multiple choice question fav_fruit that asked you to choose your favorite fruit from a list of options, and a target question num_fruit that asked how many fruit you eat per day. If we wanted to show the num_fruit question so long as the fav_fruit question is answered, we can use sd_is_answered(\"fav_fruit\") in the sd_show_if() function, like this:\n\nsd_show_if(\n  sd_is_answered(\"fav_fruit\") ~ \"num_fruit\" \n)\n\nThis way, as long as the fav_fruit question is answered, no matter which option the user picks the num_fruit question will appear.\nFor \"matrix\" type questions, sd_is_answered() will only be TRUE if all sub-questions (matrix rows)in it are answered.",

    "section": "Conditions with custom functions",
    "text": "Conditions with custom functions\nFor situations where the conditional logic is more complex, we recommend defining a custom function that will return a logical value (TRUE or FALSE). You can then pass this function to the sd_show_if() or sd_skip_if() functions as a condition.\nFor example, let’s say we had a mc type question where we asked how many cars the respondent owned, and we included numeric options 1 through 5 as well as a final option \"6 or more\". If we wanted to set a condition that would return TRUE if the user had more than one car, we could not use as.numeric(input$question_id) &gt; 1 because this would return NA if the respondent chose the \"6 or more\" option.\nTo address this, we could create a custom function to handle this special condition:\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n\n  more_than_one_car &lt;- function(input) {\n    num_cars &lt;- as.numeric(input$car_number)\n    if (is.na(num_cars)) { return(TRUE) }\n    return(num_cars &gt; 1)\n  }\n\n  sd_show_if(\n    more_than_one_car(input) ~ \"car_ownership\"\n  )\n\n  sd_server(db = db)\n\n}\n\nIn the more_than_one_car() function, we first obtain the numeric value of the car_number question using as.numeric(input$car_number). If this value is NA it indicates that the respondent chose the \"6 or more\" option, in which case we return TRUE. If not, then we can be sure that num_cars is a number, and we can return the simple condition num_cars &gt; 1.\nNote that here the more_than_one_car function is defined in the condition without () after it. This is because we are passing the function itself, not the result of the function.",

    "text": "Displaying question values in the survey\nA simple example of using a reactive value is displaying a question value somewhere else in the survey.\nFor example, you might ask the respondent’s name in a question and then display their name somewhere else in the survey, like in a greeting message. First, you would ask the respondent’s name in a question in your survey.qmd file:\n\nsd_question(\n  type  = \"text\",\n  id    = \"name\",\n  label = \"What is your name?\"\n)\n\nThen you can use the sd_output() function to display the value of the \"name\" question elsewhere in the survey. For example, you could display the name in a greeting message:\n\nWelcome, `r sd_output(\"name\", type = \"value\")`!\n\nIf the respondent entered “Dave” in the name question, this would render as:\n\nWelcome, Dave!\n\nThe type = \"value\" argument tells sd_output() to display the value of the question rather than the question itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow this works under the hood\n\n\n\nEvery question has it’s own id. To access the value that a respondent chose, we can’t use the same id. To address this, whenever you create a question we automatically create an object stored as id_value to store the value chosen by the respondent.\nFor example, if the question id was \"name\", then the value would be stored as \"name_value\". In the sd_output() function, when you use type = \"value\", the function automatically appends this _value to the id to get the question value we want to display, then uses an appropriate shiny output function to display it, e.g. shiny::textOutput().\nYou can also use type = \"question\" to display questions that are defined in the server() function in your app.R file (see the defining questions in the server function section below).",

You can do this by defining a completion code in the server() function and then storing it in the survey data using the sd_store_value() function.\nSince completion codes are often needed, we made a simple sd_completion_code() function that returns a random numeric completion code as a string. Here’s an example of how to use it:\n\n# Make a 10-digit random number completion code\ncompletion_code &lt;- sd_completion_code(10)\n\n# Store the completion code in the survey data\nsd_store_value(completion_code)\n\nThis will store the completion code in the survey data under the completion_code column.\nYou can then display the completion code at the end of the survey using the sd_output() function in your survey.qmd file, like this:\n\nYour code is: `r sd_output(\"completion_code\", type = 'value')`\n\nThis should render as something like this:\n\nYour code is: 7408931907",

This is a general issue for Shiny - outputs can only be used once per each unique id (see this GitHub issue on the topic).\nThe solution that we use is to simply make a copy of the value and then display the copy (this is also the solution on the GitHub issue linked above).\nTo do so, in the server function in the app.R file use the sd_copy_value() function to create a copy of the value, like this:\n\nsd_copy_value(id = \"name\", id_copy = \"name_copy\")\n\nYou can then use the sd_output() function in your survey.qmd file to display both the original and copied values. For example:\n\nWelcome, `r sd_output(\"name\", type = \"value\")`!\n\nIs it alright if we call you `r sd_output(\"name_copy\", type = \"value\")`?\n\nIf the respondent entered “Dave” in the name question, this would render as:\n\nWelcome, Dave!\nIs it alright if we call you Dave?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you find this annoying, we agree!

You can do this by defining the question in the server function and then displaying it in the survey.qmd file using the sd_output() function.\nFor example, let’s say you want to ask a follow-up question based on the respondent’s answer to a previous question. To do this, you would define the first question in the survey.qmd file as usual, e.g.:\n\nsd_question(\n  id     = \"pet_type\",\n  type   = \"mc\",\n  label  = \"Which do you like more, dogs or cats?\",\n  option = c(\"Dogs\" = \"dog\", \"Cats\" = \"cat\")\n)\n\nMy follow-up question is whether or not the respondent has a pet of the type they chose above. To do this, you would define the follow-up question in the app.R file’s server() function like this:\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n\n  observe({\n    pet_type &lt;- input$pet_type\n\n    # Make the question label and options\n    label &lt;-glue::glue(\"Are you a {pet_type} owner?\")\n    options &lt;- c('yes', 'no')\n    names(options)[1] &lt;- glue::glue(\"Yes, am a {pet_type} owner\")\n    names(options)[2] &lt;- glue::glue(\"No, I am not a {pet_type} owner\")\n\n    # Make the question\n    sd_question(\n      type   = \"mc\",\n      id     = \"pet_owner\",\n      label  = label,\n      option = options\n    )\n  })\n\n  sd_server()\n}\n\nThe pet_owner question is a reactive question where the label and options will change based on the respondent’s answer to the pet_type question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe observe() function is used to create the reactive question. This is a core concept in Shiny reactivity that allows you to create reactive expressions that can change based on the values of other reactive expressions.\nAlso, in this example we use the glue package to create the question label and options. This is a powerful package for creating strings that contain variable values.\n\n\nFinally, you can display the pet_owner question in the survey.qmd file using the sd_output() function, like this:\n\n```{r}\nsd_output(id = \"pet_owner\", type = \"question\")\n```",

Since surveydown users will be collecting potentially sensitive data from survey respondents, we have tried to develop the platform with data security in mind. We have taken care to follow many best practices, such as using SQL injection prevention strategies in how we store the survey response data, and ensuring that users store their database credentials as a .env file that is also added to a .gitignore file. We also adopted an architecture where all content on any page in the survey is served entirely from the shiny server, meaning that respondents taking the survey cannot see the underlying html source code for any of the content being displayed in the survey. This is important so respondents cannot see content on other pages (e.g., completion codes) before getting there from the survey navigation buttons.\nDespite our efforts, however, we do not (yet) have any form of security compliance certificate that we can provide. This means we cannot guarantee the application code is compliant with common security protocols, such as SOC2 Type 2 or HIPPA. This is an eventual goal, but for now this is a limitation for using this package for some domains that require certain certifications.",

Here are some guides for several other alternatives:\n\nPosit Connect Cloud\nHugging Face\nHeroku\n\nYou can also install Posit Connect on your own server, which is the recommended approach for remaining compliant with any security protocols your organization requires.\nWhatever hosting service you choose, please read carefully about the security implications of the environment you choose.",

You can modify any of the system messages in this file to be used in your survey.\nBelow is an example of the translations.yml file for all default English messages. The keys represent the system message identifiers, and the values are the translated messages:\nen:\n  cancel: Cancel\n  confirm_exit: Confirm Exit\n  sure_exit: Are you sure you want to exit the survey?\n  submit_exit: Submit and Exit\n  warning: Warning\n  required: Please answer all required questions before proceeding.\n  rating_title: Before you go...\n  rating_text: 'Rate your survey experience:'\n  rating_scale: from 1-poor to 5-excellent\n  next: Next\n  exit: Exit Survey\n  close_tab: Please close this tab manually to exit the survey.\n  choose_option: Choose an option...\n  click: Click here\n  redirect: Redirecting in\n  seconds: seconds\n  new_tab: Opens in a new tab\n  redirect_error: 'Error: This text won''t trigger any redirection...'\nWhen you run your survey, {surveydown} will detect the translations.yml file in your root folder and use it to override the default translations. If you provide translations for a language not supported by default, you can use the language argument in sd_server() to set your custom language code. Note that the chosen language still must be from the current list of supported languages.\nFor example, suppose you added translations for Portuguese in your translations.yml:\npt:\n  next: 'Próximo'\n  exit: 'Sair da Pesquisa'\n  # ... other messages\nIn your app.R file, set the language to Portuguese:\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n  sd_server(\n    language = \"pt\"\n  )\n}\n\nIt is also possible to have multiple translations for different translations in a single translations.yml file and simply select the required language one within the sd_server() function with the matching country code.",
